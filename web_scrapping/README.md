# Web_scrapping
The internet is full of huge amount of data which can be used for different purposes. 
To collect this data we need to know how to scrape data from a website.
 Web Scrapping is the process of extracting and collecting data
from websites and storing in a database or local machine.

### For this project I would be using 
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- Requests 
To achieve my goals. It also important that we understand HTML tags, ids, and classes, therefore basics of HTML. They would help us target the content we are in need of.
